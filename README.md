# Hi, my name is Raffaele Fiorillo. Welcome to my profile!ðŸ‘‹
I am passionate about acquiring new skills and expanding my expertise. I am driven by hard work and punctuality, embodying a deep respect for others. My background is in Computer Engineering and Telecommunications but I am currently pursuing a master's degree in Game Design and Playful Media.

I aquired some professional programming and software development skills. In my free time I like to apply Artificial Intelligence models to gaming environments, exploring areas like Deep Neural Networks, Reinforcement Learning and Genetic Algorithms. I would like to work in game design and development, enhancing technical abilities, and crafting immersive narratives to deliver unforgettable gaming experiences.

Video games have always been a profound passion of mine, from the moment I first held a joystick. I was drawn to the limitless possibilities of game development, finding fulfillment in crafting experiences that bring the realm of imagination into the real world.
